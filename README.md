# get-em-all

Check-lists mainly for biking and hiking, but any other activities are more than welcome.

### Meta

1. This should be in English. _Was stupid to start it in Romanian._
2. The folder structure is:
   - Activity type
   - Season
   - Length
3. Every check-list si structured like:
   - *Assumptions* about various environment factors
such as: water/no water, food/no food, indoor/tent/shelter, bed/without bed.
   - *Fuel*
   - *Clothing*
   - *Devices*
   - *Infrastructure*
   - *Hygiene*
